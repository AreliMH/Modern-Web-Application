# website
The project aimed to develop a modern, responsive web application, blending software engineering principles, scientific research, and web development tools. The process included iterative prototyping and an analysis of existing web applications to gain insights into repository usage by software teams. By applying the software engineering lifecycle, the team successfully designed, developed, and deployed a prototype. This effort honed expertise in Git, development environments, UI/UX design, and web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, culminating in a functional responsive website and a richer understanding of essential tools and workflows.
